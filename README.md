# PowerBi-E-com-Sales-Dashboard
Just wrapped up an exciting Power BI project: an interactive e-commerce sales dashboard that brings online sales data to life!
Key highlights:
Built dynamic visualizations (bar charts, pie charts, donut charts, clustered bars, scatter plots, line charts, area charts, maps, and more) for deep insights at a glance.
Implemented complex parameters, filters, and slicers for seamless drill-downs and user-driven customization.
Connected and joined multiple tables, crafted DAX calculations to manipulate data, and enabled intuitive interactivity.
This project sharpened my skills in data modeling, visualization best practices, and turning raw sales metrics into actionable stories. Perfect for any data analyst toolkit!
